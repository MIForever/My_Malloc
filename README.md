# Welcome to My Malloc
***

## Task
The task is to create an implementation of all the allocation-related functions such as malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.

## Description
We searched it online, went through dozens of websites, and of course watched some YouTube tutorials. It required a lot of knowledge.
It was so hard to realize how to write the main logic of the code.

## Installation
There is a file called Makefile. If you are using ZSH, you can simply build it by typing the make command.

## Usage
There is nothing to explain. It works just as the functions that were talked about above. You can test it by changing the inside of the main function in main.c file.
```
make
```
After making, enter:
```
./my_malloc
```
